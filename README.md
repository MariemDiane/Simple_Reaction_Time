# Simple reaction time of ipsilateral and contralateral hand to lateralized visual stimuli
## Simplified version of Berlucchi et al., 1971

### Goal
- See whether visual stimuli presented on one side of the fixation point elicit faster reactions from the ipsilateral than from the contralateral hand. 

### Stimuli
- A white square of 50-pixel sides, presented on a black window. 
- In half the trials, the square is presented on the left (-200, 0). 
- In the other half of the trials, the square is presented on the right (200, 0).


### Structure of study

##### The study contains two blocks. 
- In the Block LH (Left Hand): subjects are instructed to respond with their left hand.
- In the Block RH (Right Hand): subjects are instructed to respond with their right hand.
- Order of presentation of blocks is counterbalanced across subjects: subject with an even number ID start with Block RH, and subjects with an uneven number ID start with Block LH. 

#####  Each block contains 20 trials. 
- Of those 20 trials, 10 trials contain stimuli presented on the left, and 10 trials contain stimuli presented on the right. 
- The trials appear in random order. 
- The delay of apparition of the stimuli varies randomly between 1sc and 2sc.
