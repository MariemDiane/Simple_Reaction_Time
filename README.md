# Simple reaction time of ipsilateral and contralateral hand to lateralized visual stimuli
### Berlucchi et al., 1971

### Goals
- See whether visual stimuli presented on one side of the fixation point elicit faster reactions from the ipsilateral than from the contralateral hand. 

### Structure of article

- 3 sessions
- Within each session, 3 parts; 1 angle per part (5°, 20°, 35°)
- Randomisation: "Whether the stimulus would appear in the right or left field and whether the right or left hand would be used first, was decided on a random basis for each part of the session.""

-  Within each part, 2 subparts (One where stimulus appears on one side, and the other where the stimulus appears on the other side; same visual angle)
- Within each subpart, 4 blocks: 1st and 4th with one hand, 2cnd and 3rd with the other hand
- Within each block, 15 trials

### Teacher suggestion: keep it simple. Maybe onl'y include ipsolateral/contralateral variations among blocks. 
That means, for example: 
- Block 1: Random Left or Right stimulus, answer with Right hand. 
- Block 2: Random Left or Right stimulus, answer with Left hand.
If it's okay with you, I will do this version.
